Modular Electronics Building Blocks - An Educational Tool

## Welcome!

Circuit Nodes is a CC-licensed educational tool designed to help students understand electronic circuits by physically building them. Each module consists of a small PCB mounted on a 3D-printed base with puzzle-like notches, allowing users to create circuits in a grid-based structure.

The pedagogical value lies in reinforcing the connection between abstract circuit diagrams and tangible, working implementations, making theoretical concepts easier to grasp through hands-on experimentation.

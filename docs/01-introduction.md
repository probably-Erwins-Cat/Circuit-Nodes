## Why Circuit Nodes?

Circuit Nodes is an open‑source, 3D‑printed modular system for teaching
electric circuits in schools.  

Secondary‑school students learn best when the tools they use resemble the
textbook diagrams they are taught.  Conventional kits (breadboards, loose
wires) force pupils to translate between two very different representations;
this translation is a major source of persistent misconceptions about current,
voltage and circuit behaviour.

Circuit Nodes remove that barrier.  Each 40 × 40 mm PCB *is* its schematic
symbol, and modules snap together on a square grid.  Magnets and geometry make
incorrect wiring virtually impossible, so pupils can concentrate on the physics.

The system can be summarised as
inexpensive, easy to adapt to lesson plans and effective at reducing abstraction.

The idea and evaluation is further outline in a peer‑reviewed
paper: **"Modular 3D‑printed Circuit Nodes for low‑cost and hands‑on Electricity
Education"** (Phys. Educ. 61 015010, 2024, [DOI 10.1088/1361-6552/ae1abd](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6552/ae1abd)).


## Practical Examples

Here are some practical examples of node layouts and module sets:

## What’s in this repository?

- Schematics and Gerber files for every PCB module.
- FreeCAD models plus STL/STEP exports for the 3‑D printed bases.
- Assembly instructions, example circuits and documentation.
- A bill‑of‑materials and production notes for magnets, screws, etc.
- Source images such as `assembly.png` used throughout the docs.

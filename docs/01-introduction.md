# Introduction to Circuit Nodes

![Circuit Nodes Logo]({{ site.baseurl }}/../logo.png){: width="300" }

Circuit Nodes is an open‑source, 3‑D‑printed modular system for teaching
electric circuits in schools.  The idea and evaluation appear in a peer‑reviewed
paper: **"Modular 3D‑printed Circuit Nodes for low‑cost and hands‑on Electricity
Education"** (Phys. Educ. 61 015010, 2024, [DOI 10.1088/1361-6552/ae1abd](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6552/ae1abd)).

## What’s in this repository?

- Schematics and Gerber files for every PCB module.
- FreeCAD models plus STL/STEP exports for the 3‑D printed bases.
- Assembly instructions, example circuits and documentation.
- A bill‑of‑materials and production notes for magnets, screws, etc.
- Source images such as `assembly.png` used throughout the docs.

## Why Circuit Nodes?

Secondary‑school students learn best when the tools they use resemble the
textbook diagrams they are taught.  Conventional kits (breadboards, loose
wires) force pupils to translate between two very different representations;
this translation is a major source of persistent misconceptions about current,
voltage and circuit behaviour.

Circuit Nodes remove that barrier.  Each 40 × 40 mm PCB *is* its schematic
symbol, and modules snap together on a square grid.  Magnets and geometry make
incorrect wiring virtually impossible, so pupils can concentrate on the physics.

The published teacher survey (eight physics teachers) summarised the system as
inexpensive, easy to adapt to lesson plans and effective at reducing abstraction.
Reservations focused on the effort required to produce a full set and on printer
access; both issues are addressed in the documentation and by offering pre‑made
kits.

## Use cases

* **Classroom experiments** – series/parallel circuits, measurements, simple
  electronic components.  Designed for secondary‑school physics courses.
* **Teacher‑training and makerspaces** – small batches can be made on site,
  giving trainees hands‑on experience.
* **University labs** – a low‑cost supplement to theory work, especially in
  education or outreach modules.

(Non‑school applications such as hobby prototyping are not the focus.)

## Research summary

The associated paper provides details of the design rationale, cost analysis
and teacher feedback; the full text is linked above.  In brief, teachers found
that the nodes cleared up confusion, lowered material costs by an order of
magnitude and allowed sets to be customised to school curricula.  Damage tests
with twelve‑year‑olds showed the modules withstand routine classroom use.

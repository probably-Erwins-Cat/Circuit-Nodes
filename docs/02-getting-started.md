# Getting Started with Circuit Nodes

## Overview

![Assembly overview]({{ site.baseurl }}/../assembly.png){: width="800" }

Circuit Nodes are modular PCBs that snap together on a square grid to form real circuits. This page gives a quick overview before you move on to assembly.

## The Basic Concept

Each puzzle piece is a PCB with a single component; the edges carry magnets that provide both the mechanical and electrical connection. Modules are arranged on a grid and the schematic symbol is printed on the board so the layout matches the diagram.

Research shows that translating between flat schematics and messy physical builds is a major obstacle in school circuits. Circuit Nodes remove that step: the arrangement pupils draw is the arrangement they build, so they can concentrate on the physics.

**Benefits for a classroom:**

- **Less extraneous confusion** – no loose wires to untangle.
- **Immediate visual match** – the build looks like the diagram.
- **Errors are obvious** – pieces simply won’t connect incorrectly.
- **Safe handling** – low‑voltage, enclosed components keep students focused on concepts.
- **Low barrier to entry** – small groups can achieve success quickly.

## System Components

### 1. **Puzzle Pieces (PCBs)**
Small circuit boards with:
- Active components (resistors, LEDs, switches, etc.)
- Passive components (wire traces, connections)
- Schematic diagram printed on the silkscreen
- Mounting holes for base assembly
- Connector pads for magnetic connections

### 2. **3D-Printed Bases**
Frame that holds the PCB with:
- Interlocking puzzle-like edges
- Pockets for magnetic connectors
- M2 screw mounting points
- Various style options (open-bottom, magnetic-bottom, skeletonized)

### 3. **Magnetic Connectors**
Small magnets that:
- Provide physical attachment between pieces
- Act as electrical contacts for circuit connections
- Enable quick assembly and disassembly

## What You'll Need

To start using Circuit Nodes:

### Minimum Setup
1. **PCBs** - At least 3-5 basic pieces to form a simple circuit
2. **3D-Printed Bases** - One per PCB
3. **Magnetic Connectors** - About 2 per piece (depending on connections needed)
4. **M2 Screws** - 4 per base (self-tapping or with heat inserts)
5. **Power Source** - USB-C PD or benchtop supply depending on circuit

### Optional But Recommended
- Basic measurement tools (multimeter)
- Component storage boxes
- Magnetic-backed board (if using magnetic bases)

## Getting Your First Kit

### Option 1: Build Your Own
1. Download Gerber files from the repository
2. Order PCBs from a fabrication service
3. Source magnetic connectors and screws
4. Print the bases on a 3D printer
5. Assemble following the detailed instructions

### Option 2: Pre‑Made Kits
Ready‑made sets are offered at three levels:

- [Entry‑level kit](#) – power, basic resistor/LED modules
- [Intermediate kit](#) – adds switches and measurement nodes
- [Advanced kit](#) – full classroom curriculum set

Contact the project maintainer for ordering information.

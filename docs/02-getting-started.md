# Getting Started

## The Basic Concept

Circuit Nodes are modular PCBs that snap together on a square grid to form real circuits. This page gives a quick overview before you move on.
Each puzzle piece is a PCB with a single component; the edges carry magnets that provide both the mechanical and electrical connection. Modules are arranged on a grid and the schematic symbol is printed on the board so the layout matches the diagram.

Research shows that translating between flat schematics and messy physical builds is a major obstacle in school circuits. Circuit Nodes remove that step: the arrangement pupils draw is the arrangement they build, so they can concentrate on the physics.

## Components

### 1. **Puzzle Pieces (PCBs)**
Small circuit boards with:
- Active components (resistors, LEDs, switches, etc.)
- Passive components (wire traces, connections)
- Schematic diagram printed on the silkscreen
- manufacturing files conveniendly provided here

### 2. **3D-Printed Bases**
Frame that holds the PCB with:
- Interlocking puzzle-like edges
- Pockets for magnetic connectors
- M2 screw mounting points
- Various style options (open-bottom, magnetic-bottom)
- also provided here as STL, STEP and FreeCAD source file

### 3. **Magnetic Connectors**
Small magnetig connectors found in detachable charging cables that:
- Provide physical attachment between pieces
- Act as electrical contacts for circuit connections
- Enable quick assembly and disassembly

### 4. Further **Components**
Additional modules introduce core circuit elements:
- **Lamps** for visible load behavior and current draw
- **LEDs** for polarity-aware visual feedback
- **Resistors** to set current and divide voltage
- **Magnets** for optional magnetic base, ideal for blackboard use

Together, these parts let you build a wide range of beginner and intermediate analog circuit examples.

## Getting Your First Kit

### Option 1: Build Your Own
1. Download Gerber files from the repository
2. Order PCBs from a fabrication service
3. Source magnetic connectors and screws
4. Print the bases on a 3D printer
5. Assemble following the detailed instructions

### Option 2: Curated, Pre‑Made Kits
Ready‑made sets are offered at three levels:

- [Entry‑level kit](#) – power, basic modules for lamps and switches
- [Intermediate kit](#) – adds measurement nodes, resistors and LEDs
- [Advanced kit](#) – full classroom curriculum set




## What You'll Need for Assembly

To start using Circuit Nodes:

### Minimum Setup
1. **PCBs** - At least 3-5 basic pieces to form a simple circuit
2. **3D-Printed Bases** - One per PCB
3. **Magnetic Connectors** - About 2 per piece (depending on connections needed)
4. **M2 Screws** - 4 per base (self-tapping or with heat inserts)
5. **Power Source** - USB-C PD or benchtop supply depending on circuit and PCBs

# Plus End Node

This puzzle piece is a labeled connector for the positive pole (supply voltage) of a power source. It features an M6-sized hole where a red banana plug terminal is typically screwed in, following the standard convention that the plus pole is associated with supply voltage and red indicates the positive connection.

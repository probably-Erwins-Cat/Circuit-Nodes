# Intro

Here are all puzzle pieces collected and constantly updated. The naming schemes follows the schematic pictogramm names, i.e. the name of the actual component is not part of it. Withing the dedicated folders of the puzzle pieces you will find another readme specifying the component names that are compatible with the pictogramm, e.g. the folder "n-channel-mosfet" contains the puzzle piece for a pictographic n-channel mosfet and also specifies which n-channel mosfet(s) are a good choice for that specific puzzle piece, 2N7000.

# Design Template

They layout of the puzzle pieces is always the same and only needs additional specific routes for the displayed circuit symbols. The cornerstone of the layout is:
* 40x40mm square outline
* rounded courners, radius = 4mm
* 4 screw holes in the corner, 4mm away from the edges, 2.9mm diameter (M3 screws will slightly carve the board)
* copper pour should have large gap from active circuitry
* no copper pour 2mm around the board edge
* pictogram line style 2mm thick (approx 5.7pts)
* hole spacing of magentic connector should not be altered

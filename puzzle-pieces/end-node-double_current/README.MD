# Current Measurement End Node (Ammeter Connector)

This puzzle piece provides two connectors designed specifically for measuring current with an ammeter. Both terminals are labeled with arrow markers to indicate current direction. Since modern ammeters typically work equally well with current flowing in either direction, the polarity is more about teaching good practice and helping students follow the conventional current flow from positive (red terminal) to negative (black terminal).

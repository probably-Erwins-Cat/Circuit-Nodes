# Intro  
This piece is a generic breadboard grid with 2.54mm spacing as displayed. It is a placeholder for self-soldered circuits when a user wants to implement something more complicated into a miniature version. It exists in various versions and sizes. The square holes with rounded corners also work for large SMT parts, too, albeit not optimized for those.

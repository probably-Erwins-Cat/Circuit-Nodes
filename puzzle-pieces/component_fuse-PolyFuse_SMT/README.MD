# Polyfuse (resettable fuse, SMT)

A polyfuse is a resettable protection device that increases resistance when heated by an overcurrent and returns to a low-resistance state when cooling. It is useful in classroom kits because it reduces the need to replace components after minor faults.

## Typical uses in circuits
- Overcurrent protection in student experiments and small supply modules.

## Didactical notes
- Polyfuses make a good demonstration of thermal feedback and protection behaviours: students can see the circuit limit current and recover after a fault is removed.

## Practical and safety notes
- Choose a polyfuse with an appropriate hold current for your expected loads (for many classroom activities ~100 mA is a reasonable starting point).
- Polyfuses are not instantaneous and may not protect very sensitive components from brief surges; they are a general safeguard rather than a precise protection device.

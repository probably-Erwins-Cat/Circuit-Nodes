# Resistor (SMT) — printed value set

This set provides SMT resistor footprints with the resistance value printed on the silkscreen. It is convenient for classroom kits where students should quickly identify the mounted value without reading tiny SMD markings.

## Typical uses in circuits
- The same as other resistors: current limiting, voltage division, and basic signal conditioning. The printed values simply make identification easier in teaching contexts.

## Practical and safety notes
- Power dissipation: calculate with
	\[P = U \cdot I = I^2 \cdot R = \dfrac{U^2}{R}.\]
	Check that the selected package and resistor power rating suit your experiment.

## E-series and kit guidance
- Use E-series preferred values (E12/E24) to plan a compact kit. Keep a selection of common values such as 100 Ω, 330 Ω, 1 kΩ, 10 kΩ to support typical classroom activities.

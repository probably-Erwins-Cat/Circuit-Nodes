# Intro  
AC source, as displayed. It comes with an M6-sized hole where a typical banana plug can be screwed in. Recommended bana jacks are with pass-through, instead of the typical blind hole, see image. Since AC has no dedicated plus and minus, better use a different color for the jack than black and red.

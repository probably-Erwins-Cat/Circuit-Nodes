# Intro  
This is a simple wire segment as displayed without node for voltage measurement.

Note, this bridge connects the horizontal nodes and the vertical nodes but not diagonally, like a bridge. Virtually all circuits in school can be build in 2D, but some special circuits benefit from having access to the third dimension via a bridge, e.g. full bridge rectifiers and multi-switch circuits. A bridge can also be build using two end nodes and a normal banana plug wire. Thus, this puzzle piece is technically not necessary but having one around is a nice addition.

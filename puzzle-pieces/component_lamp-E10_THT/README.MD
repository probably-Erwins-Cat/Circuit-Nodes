# Intro  
A **lamp** is usually the intro component in education as it makes "invisible" electricity visibly via light and heat emmission. It **limits the flow of electric current** and thereby producing heat, like a resistor.   
Resistors follow **Ohm's Law (V = I Ã— R)**, meaning the voltage drop across the resistor is proportional to the current flowing through it. Lamps are slightly special, their resistance **increases** with temperature, thereby feathering the limit of heat dissipation and current flow.

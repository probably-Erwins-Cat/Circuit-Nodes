# Intro  
A **polarized capacitor** is an electronic component that **stores and releases electrical energy**. It is used in circuits to smooth out voltage, filter signals, and store energy for brief periods.  
Unlike regular capacitors, **polarized capacitors have a positive (+) and a negative (-) side**, meaning they must be connected in the correct orientation.  

# For What It Is Used  
**Polarized capacitors are commonly used in:**  
- **Power supplies:** Smoothing out fluctuations in voltage (e.g., after a rectifier).  
- **Audio circuits:** Blocking DC voltage while allowing AC signals to pass.  
- **Energy storage:** Providing a quick burst of power when needed.  

## Advantages of Polarized Capacitors  
✅ **High capacitance:** Can store more energy than non-polarized capacitors of the same size.  
✅ **Great for low-frequency applications:** Works well in power supplies and audio circuits.  
✅ **Reliable for energy buffering:** Helps stabilize voltage in circuits.  

# Functional Description  

A **capacitor stores electrical charge**, similar to how a **flexible membrane inside a water pipe stores energy**.  

## The Two Terminals and Their Roles  

| **Capacitor (Electricity)** | **Water Analogy (Hydrodynamics)** |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Positive (+) terminal** | **One side of a flexible membrane** inside a pipe |
| **Negative (-) terminal** | **The other side of the membrane** |
| **Charging (current flows in)** | Water pushes against the membrane, stretching it |
| **Discharging (current flows out)** | The membrane returns to its normal shape, pushing water back |

## How It Works  
- **Charging:** When voltage is applied, **charge flows in**, pushing against an internal insulating layer (like a rubber membrane) and storing energy.  
- **Discharging:** When the voltage source is removed, the stored energy is released as current flows back out.  
- **Blocking DC / Passing AC:** The capacitor **blocks direct current (DC)** because once charged, no more current flows. However, **alternating current (AC) can pass**, as the charge builds and releases in cycles.  

# Important Considerations  

⚠️ **Polarity Matters!** If connected **backwards**, a polarized capacitor **may overheat, leak, or even explode**.  
⚠️ **Voltage Rating:** The capacitor’s voltage rating **must be higher than the circuit voltage** to avoid failure.  
⚠️ **ESR (Equivalent Series Resistance):** In high-frequency applications, lower ESR is preferred to reduce heat and losses.  

# Compatible and Recommended Part(s)  
For general-purpose use, the following THT electrolytic capacitors are widely available:  
- **1000µF, 25V** – Good for power supply filtering.  
- **470µF, 16V** – Common in audio circuits.  
- **10µF, 50V** – Useful for small signal applications.  

When selecting a capacitor, always check:  
- **Capacitance value (µF)**
- **Voltage rating (V)**
- **Size (to fit your circuit board)**

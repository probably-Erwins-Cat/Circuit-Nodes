# Circuit Nodes - Modular Electronics Building Blocks

Circuit Nodes is an open-source educational tool designed to help students and enthusiasts understand electronic circuits by physically building them. Each module consists of a small PCB mounted on a 3D-printed base with puzzle-like notches, allowing users to create circuits in a grid-based structure. The PCBs include simple circuit elements such as resistors, capacitors, wire traces, switches, LEDs, lamps, and voltage or current measurement points, with their schematic representations printed directly on them. Magnetic connectors enable both physical attachment and electrical connection.

This system provides a low-cost entry point into electronics education while remaining highly scalable. By starting with basic components and expanding into more complex circuits, learners of all levels can benefit. The pedagogical value lies in reinforcing the connection between abstract circuit diagrams and tangible, working implementations, making theoretical concepts easier to grasp through hands-on experimentation.

# Features

If you are an educator or represent a school interested in testing Circuit Nodes, I can provide kits for evaluation and classroom use. Please reach out for more details.

* Pre-Assembled Kits Available: If the initial effort of manufacturing and assembling the components seems too high, I can provide ready-made circuit kits to make getting started easier.

* Modular Design: 40x40mm PCBs mounted on 3D-printed bases with interlocking puzzle-like edges.

* Hands-on Learning: Users assemble working circuits based on schematic diagrams.

* Magnetic Connectors: Ensure secure physical and electrical connections.

* Visual Representation: Each PCB features the corresponding circuit schematic for intuitive learning.

* Expandable: Additional modules with more components can be designed and added.

*Low Cost & Scalable: An affordable introduction to electronics that can be expanded as needed.

# Getting Started

* Download the necessary Gerber files for the circuits or kits you want to build from this repository. Refer to the repository contents below for a dedicated kits list and example circuits.

* Manufacture the PCBs using your preferred PCB fabrication service.

* 3D print the bases using the provided STL files.

* Assemble the modules by attaching the PCBs to the bases, soldering the magnetic connectors and circuit components if they are not pre-assembled during the PCB manufacturing process.

*Start building and experimenting with different circuit configurations!

# Repository Contents

* Gerber Files: Ready-to-fabricate PCB designs for all modules.

* 3D Print Files: STL files for printing the interlocking bases.

* Assembly Instructions: Guidelines for assembling the modules.

* Example Circuits: Sample configurations to demonstrate different circuit principles, structured according to different classes, difficulty levels, and topics. These examples help guide learners through progressively complex circuits, making them suitable for both beginners and advanced users.

# Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit pull requests with new module designs, improvements, or documentation updates. If you are a teacher and would like to see specific schematics that align with your curriculum, but lack the KiCad skills to design them, I am happy to assist with the schematic design process. Just reach out with your requirements, and I can help bring them to life for your students.

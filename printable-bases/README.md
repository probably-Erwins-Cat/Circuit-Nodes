# Printable Base

The printable base comes either with closed bottom and optional magnet pocket for blackboard use or open bottom for easier repairablility. 

## Tolerance
The numbering at the end of the file name, e.g. "0.2", describes the tolerance in millimeter for the hexagona docking. The larger, the looser the fit. **Users should aim for the tighter fit without causing part friction**. Tighter tolerances help the magnetic connectors to auto-align the pirntable bases the best. On current-generation hobbyist printers, a **tolerance of 0.2mm is a good starting point** typically resulting in good alignment without reasonable friction.

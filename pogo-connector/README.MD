# Pogo Connector

Circuit Nodes are primarily designed with the connector in mind depicted in the [PDF](magnetic_spring_loaded_pogo_connector.pdf). It contains two spring-loaded pogo pins for secure electrical contact, two north-south oriented magnets, angled solder leads, and rounded pastic wings for alignment in the printed base. In short, it ticks all the boxes and is the prefect parts for this application. This parts comes with varying number of terminals with 2 being the version needed for *Circuit Nodes*. This part can be found on various websites, e.g. LCSC, aliexpress, and taobao, or the manufacturer, Samzo Components, can be directly contacted. Due to the current popularity, this part is sometimes out-of-stock/has an queue attached.

# Alternative Connector

There is a very similar connector that is missing the rounded plastic wings and has instead tiny corner wings. It is a fraction of a millimeter wider, so this one will fit a little tighter and might need a little bit more force to insert (or larger printable part tolerance, not recommended). It also comes with the same North-South- orientation, so it is compatible with the ideal connector.

# Other Options, not designed yet.

There are also versions for normal pogo connector in the making where the user must manually add magnets in two separate pockets. Those pogo connectors' advantage are lower price and simpler soldering when the right equipment is available (hot plate). Their downside is manual assembly and orientation of separate magnets. Since special equipment is needed (or a large order must be outsourced to become financially viable), this version is currently being evaluated before release.
